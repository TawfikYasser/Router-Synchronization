# Router-Synchronization
This repo for assignment 2 in operating systems about Java Synchronization
###### Problem description
It is required to simulate a limited number of devices connected to a routerâ€™s Wi-Fi using Java threading and semaphore. Routers can be designed to limit the number of open connections. For example, a Router may wish to have only N connections at any point in time. As soon as N connections are made, the Router will not accept other incoming connection until an existing connection is released. Explain how semaphores can be used by a Router to limit the number of concurrent connections.

###### Problem Design
1.	Router Class: that contains a list of connection and methods to occupy a connection and release a connection.
2.	Semaphore Class: as given the synchronization lab.
3.	Device Class: represent different devices (threads) that can be connected to the router; each device has its own name (i.e. C1) and type (i.e. mobile, pc, tablet...) and it may perform three activities: connect, perform online activity and disconnect/logout.
4.	Network Class: this class contains the main method in which the user is asked for two inputs:
   *	N: max number of connections a router can accept
   *	TC: total number of devices that wishes to connect).
   *	TC lines that contain: name of each device, and its type.
